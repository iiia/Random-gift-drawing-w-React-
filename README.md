This is a simple gift drawing app created with  <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Set your gift list and the number of people to draw. You can set each player's name by clicking the 'Edit PlayerName' button. 
  </br>
Click the 'gift icon' in the title of the first column to activate back-door system. You can assign each gift to a specific player by entering the player's No. .Gifts that not assigned with back-door number will still be random  when drawing. Click the 'gift icon' again to hide the back-door list after finishing setting. Enjoy!
  </br>
  The app shows in the demo page is an extension version. You can find the code in the "New_function" branch. The code you see in the "master" is a prototype.
