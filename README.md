This is a pure front-end random gift drawing webapp created with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a></p>

<p>
  This webapp can be used in any event that requires random drawing. Technically it has no limit in both the amount of gift and people to be drawn.
  Feel free to add or delete the items in gift list, and set the number of people to be drawn.
</br>
</p>
<p>
If the number you drew is not available (etc the person had left or you merely just don't like the number to be drawn) and you need to draw again for the same item, press the "again" button.
</br>
If you're statisfied with a draw, press "next" to draw for the next gift.
</br>
If you change the number of people after pressing "start", remember to press "reset" to regenerate random list buffer.
